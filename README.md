## Implemented tasks
[Interpolation, extrapolation, numerical integration](https://github.com/marfadita/computational-math/blob/main/%D0%B4%D0%B7_%D1%81%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%8F%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5/%D0%B4%D0%B71_%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%BC1.ipynb)
The methods of Newton interpolation, splines, and undefined coefficients are implemented. A method of integration using the Simpson formula with an optimized spatial grid step is shown.

[Solving systems of differential equations](https://github.com/marfadita/computational-math/blob/main/%D0%B4%D0%B7_%D1%81%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%8F%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5/%D0%B4%D0%B72_%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%BC1.ipynb)
Explicit and implicit Runge-Kutta methods are implemented. Methods of targeting and quasi-linearization were also shown. The stability of certain methods on the three-body problem is investigated

[Solving initial boundary value problems](https://github.com/marfadita/computational-math/blob/main/%D0%B4%D0%B7_%D1%81%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%8F%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5/%D0%B4%D0%B72_%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%BC1.ipynb)
The transfer equations on the angle and Lax-Wendroff scheme are solved numerically. The problem of gas dynamics on the Courant–Izakson–Rice scheme is solved. The stability of different methods depending on the number of chimes is investigated.
